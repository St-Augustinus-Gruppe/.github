With the Christian non-profit St. Augustinus Group, we are one of the largest and most successful companies in the healthcare and social sector in the Rhineland. Our focus is on somatics, psychiatry, senior care and care for the disabled.

What guides us: to provide our patients with optimal support, both professionally and humanly - and to do so in a maximum feel-good ambience. Excellent physicians and dedicated staff face this task with full devotion every day.
